/*Create a Java program that simulates a simple banking system using inheritance. The system should include the following:

A base class BankAccount with attributes for account number and balance, and methods for depositing and withdrawing money.
A derived class SavingsAccount that extends BankAccount with an additional attribute for interest rate and a method to apply interest.
A derived class CheckingAccount that extends BankAccount with an additional attribute for overdraft limit and an overridden method for withdrawing money to account for the overdraft limit.
A main class to create instances of SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount, and demonstrate the functionality of deposit, withdraw, and other specific methods. */
